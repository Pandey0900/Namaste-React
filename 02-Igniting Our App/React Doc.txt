	i.dev dependancies:- this is use for when we are developing our App 
	ii.normal dependacies:- this is use for when manage the code in  production

3.  package-lock.json:- records the exact version of each installed package which allows you to re-install them. Future installs will be able to build an identical dependency tree.
    package.json:-  records the minimum version you app needs. If you update the versions of a particular package, the change is not going to be reflected here.
