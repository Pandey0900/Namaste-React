1.Running Project Scripts: When we want to run our project, we typically rely on scripts defined in the package.json file. For convenience, we can create specific scripts such as start and build to streamline common tasks.
	--> Start Script:- The npm command has a built-in keyword start, which allows us to run the start script without needing to specify the full command. Instead of typing "npm run start", we can simply use "npm start" to start the project.
	--> Build Script:- Similarly, we can define a build script in package.json to handle production builds. While npm doesn't have a shortcut for build, you can still run it easily using "npm run build"
