// JSX (transipiled before it reaches the JS Engine)
// Transpiled means -> Transpiling is converting one higher level language to another higher level language. For example, Typescript is a high level language but after it's transpiled it's turned into JavaScript (another high level language). Or Babel for example can transpile ES6 JavaScript code into ES5 JavaScript.

// Parcel is Transpiling this code, means Parcel Manages Transpiling the code which is done By the Package known as Babel. Babel is a Transpiler - A source-to-source translator, source-to-source compiler (S2S compiler), transcompiler, or transpiler is a type of translator that takes the source code of a program written in a programming language as its input and produces an equivalent source code in the same or a different programming language.
